You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

* What new skills have you learned?

* What has been easy?

* What has been difficult?

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

As far as new skills, I've picked up on the figure/figcaption elements as I have never used those before or seen them
in my personal experience or past programming classes related to this subject in the past. The concept of "trees"/parent-child
relationships was never taught to me in HTML, but I learned about it in another language. Seeing it in use with HTML helps make a ton
of sense as far as grouping particular elements together along with their child tags and such.

This wasn't too difficult as I did have the background knowledge coming into this.

These first few lessons have been easy, but have helped a lot in refreshing my knowledge as I haven't used html in awhile.

As far as problem solving goes, I've used the source material and outside research, like the MDN website on any concepts that
I need to go back over or haven't quite grasped my first time through. There's always our group discussions to look back on as well
